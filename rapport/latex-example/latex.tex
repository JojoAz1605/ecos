\section{Sommaire}

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.

\medskip
Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.

  \STATE Let $\mathcal{P}_{AB}$ be the set of paths between $A$ and $B$
  \IF{\TRUE}
   \FOR{$\forall P \in \mathcal{P}_{AB}$}
    \FOR{$\forall W_i\in P$ such that $c(W_i,B) > 0$}
     \STATE $\mathcal{P}_{AB}\leftarrow \mathcal{P}_{AB}\setminus\{P\}$ with probability $\underset{W_j\in W'}{\max} M(W_i,W_j)$

  \STATE $A$ computes $f_\mathcal{G}(A,B)$

\section{No, motherfucker}

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.

\subsection{Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!}
\label{sec::burger}

Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

\begin{definition}[Are you ready for the truth?]
Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
 \label{def::truth}
\end{definition}

Do you believe that shit in Definition~\ref{def::truth}?

\subsubsection{Is she dead, yes or no?} 

\begin{multicols}{2}
Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.

\begin{example}
It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. 
\end{example}

\end{multicols}

\subsubsection{I can do that in Section~\ref{sec::burger}} 

That's clear.

 \item Your cells 
 \item react to bacteria and viruses 
 \item differently than mine.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. 
 \item Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. 
 \item And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. 
 \item And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
\end{enumerate}
